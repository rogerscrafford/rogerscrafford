## Hi, I’m @rogerscrafford
- I work on guitars. Make that *stringed instruments*.   
  The goal is to make them play better than when they came from the builder.  
  I succeed more often than not.

- I’m also looking for first readers for the fictions I write.  
  These usually take the form of contemporary mystery/crime, though I also have a "Christmas Carol" / "Inferno" mashup in the works.  
  If you're remotely interested, you can usually reach me here: roger [at] scrafford [dot] com
